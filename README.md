I have created a User JSON file with the necessary details of the respective users. Using this file in python, I have used the news sources, parsed the xml and passed this news to the distilbart LLM.
This LLM is used from Hugging Face and summarizes the news article under 200 words. 
Once summarization is finished the markdown file is created for each user based on their interest.
