**Beyond RGB: A new image file format efficiently stores invisible light data**

 Spectral JPEG XL is a new compression format for scientific visualization and computer graphics. It tackles a serious bottleneck for industries working with specialized images. Spectral files can contain 30, 100, or more data points per pixel, causing file sizes to balloon into multi-gigabyte territory. This detailed information spans the visible spectrum and often extends into near-infrared and near-ultraviolet regions crucial for simulating how materials interact with light accurately. Researchers Alban Fichet and Christoph Peters of Intel Corporation detailed the format in a recent paper.

**Oracle has reportedly suffered 2 separate breaches exposing thousands of customers‘ PII**

 Oracle is not commenting on reports that it has experienced two separate data breaches. Bleeping Computer says one breach exposed patient data from US hospitals. In all, more than 140,000 tenants of Oracle Cloud services were affected, researchers say. An anonymous person published a sampling of what they said were 6 million records of authentication data belonging to Oracle Cloud customers eight days ago. The data appears to be genuine, according to researchers at outside security firms who have reviewed data provided by rose87168. Oracle Health customers received breach notifications that were printed on plain paper.

**Gemini hackers can deliver more potent attacks with a helping hand from… Gemini**

 In the growing canon of AI security, the indirect prompt injection has emerged as the most powerful means for attackers to hack large language models. The inner workings of so-called closed-weights models such as GPT and Anthropic’s Claude are closely held secrets. As a result, devising working prompt injections requires labor- and time-intensive trial and error through redundant manual effort. Researchers have devised a means to create computer-generated prompt injections against Gemini that have much higher success rates than manually crafted ones.

**Broadcom’s VMware says Siemens pirated “thousands” of copies of its software**

 The Broadcom company claims Siemens outed itself by revealing to it that it downloaded and distributed multiple copies of its products without buying a license. Siemens was reportedly looking to exercise a previously agreed-upon option for a one-year renewal of support services. The lawsuit was filed on March 21 in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. It says it has had a Master Software License and Service Agreement with Siemens since November 28, 2012. The suit claims that Siemens revealed that it had downloaded, copied, distributed, and deployed thousands of copies of VMware products.

**Blackstone Considers Small Investment in TikTok**

 President Trump has set a deadline for the app to change its ownership or face a U.S. ban under federal law. It is unclear if any deal will go ahead, and other investors are also circling the app. Last year, Congress passed the law that forces a sale of the app because of national security concerns related to its Chinese ownership. Mr. Trump extended the deadline for a deal in January, and suggested this week that he might relax upcoming tariffs on China in exchange for the country’s support of a deal.

**CoreWeave Disappoints on Opening of Trading**

 Some analysts remain skeptical of CoreWeave’s considerable debt, which it took on to build more data centers, the large facilities that house its A.I. chips. It lost $863 million after spending nearly $1 billion to finance its debt. It hasn’t helped that the stock price of Nvidia, the supplier of its computer chips and one of its main investors, has reeled in the last week, down 9 percent since Wednesday. The company's revenue jumped to $1.9 billion last year from $229 million a year earlier.

**FCC Orders Investigation Into Disney’s DEI Practices**

 FCC chairman says Disney's diversity, equity and inclusion programs appear to violate regulations. Brendan Carr: "I want to ensure that Disney ends any and all discriminatory initiatives in substance, not just name" A Disney spokesman said the company was reviewing the F.C.’s letter, and it looks forward to engaging with the commission to answer its questions, the spokesman said. The move is the latest attempt to halt such efforts under the Trump administration to halt efforts by the company, he said.

**Trump Pardons Trevor Milton, Founder of Bankrupt Truck Maker Nikola**

 Trevor Milton, a major Republican donor who was convicted of defrauding investors in the electric truck maker Nikola, has received a pardon from President Trump. Milton, Nikola’s founder and former chief executive, was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1 million after a New York jury convicted him of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. Mr. Milton was accused of pumping up the value of Nikola stock by making extravagant claims about the company, including that it had working prototypes of emissions-free long-haul trucks and had billions of dollars’ worth of binding orders.

**OpenAI’s new AI image generator is potent and bound to provoke**

 OpenAI announces new multimodal image-generation capabilities that are directly integrated into its GPT-4o AI language model. The integration, called "4o Image Generation," allows the model to follow prompts more accurately (with better text rendering than DALL-E 3) and respond to chat context for image modification instructions. An AI-generated photo of Abraham Lincoln holding an Ars Technica sign created by OpenAI's 4o Image Gen model. The model is now the default image generator within the ChatGPT interface.

**Open source devs say AI crawlers dominate traffic, forcing blocks on entire countries**

 Software developer Xe Iaso reached a breaking point earlier this year when aggressive AI crawler traffic from Amazon overwhelmed their Git repository service. Despite configuring standard defensive measures, AI crawlers continued evading all attempts to stop them. The developer eventually resorted to moving their server behind a VPN and creating "Anubis," a proof-of-work challenge system that forces web browsers to solve computational puzzles before accessing the site. "I don't want to have to close off my Gitea server to the public, but I will if I have to," he wrote.

**Elon Musk Says He Has Sold X to His A.I. Start-Up xAI**

 The all-stock deal valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, Musk said on X. X’s price was down from the $44 billion that Mr. Musk paid for the social media company in 2022. The last valuation of xAI, at a December fund-raising round, was about $40 billion. Both companies are privately held and already share significant resources, such as engineers and data-driven data. The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people, he said.

**Look Again: That H&M Model Showing Off a New Look May Be a Digital Clone**

 One image shows the real model posing with the fake image of her in a white shirt and jeans. The image is one of more than two dozen used by H&M this year to create digital replicas. The images were published in The Business of Fashion, a fashion magazine, this week. The magazine has raised concerns about the use of digital images to make fashion images more available online and in print. It has also raised questions about the impact of artificial images on models and hair stylists.
