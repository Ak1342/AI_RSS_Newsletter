**‘Men don’t want to be told they are toxic’: what young people really think of Adolescence**

 Adolescence is one of the first to leave me wanting to cry, but not knowing how. Shows always try to capture what teenagers are like, but they never get it as accurate as Adolescentence has. 'Society is constantly belittling and putting down young men (particularly young white men) The larger issue is society is driving young men to be influenced by people such as people like Andrew Tate, as they see no approval from anywhere in their life. 'Not being on social media until senior year of high school was the best decision,' Justin, 22, says.

**Maybe I’m Amazed by John Harris review – a father and his autistic son bond through music**

 Maybe I'm Amazed opens with John Harris’s 15-year-old son, James, ecstatically absorbed in a live performance by Paul McCartney, “so held in the moment that he is almost in an altered state” Harris divides the book into 10 chapters named after songs. One chapter takes its cue from Funkadelic's ‘weird … incongruous’ track Fish, Chips and Sweat – about a carnal encounter that takes as its backdrop “the least sexy meal imaginable”. Another is a song whose lyrics evoke “a sudden euphoria that leaves you silent, and still”

**MobLand: Tom Hardy deserves better than Guy Ritchie’s mediocre 90s-fest**

 Just describing MobLand feels like a game of 1990s nostalgia bingo. It’s directed by Guy Ritchie, the 90s director, and stars Pierce Brosnan. It's a London-set crime drama full of characters who talk in cartoonish cockney accents. The criminals are a family called the Stevensons, rather than a bunch of kids on mopeds who nick your phone and sell it to China. The show is set in present-day London, though nobody involved seems to have actually been to London for about 30 years.

**With a little help from my friend: John, Paul and the ‘romance’ that transformed culture**

 John Lennon and Paul McCartney met and fell for each other in the summer of 1957. John was 16, Paul was 14 when he joined the Quarry Men. The pair were fascinated by each other and admired each other's musical abilities and good looks. They made each other laugh more than anyone else they knew. Through music, John and Paul became vulnerable to each other through music. They allowed the other a g a g relationship: intoxicating, tender and bittersweet. Passionate male friendships like this are rare, but not unique.
