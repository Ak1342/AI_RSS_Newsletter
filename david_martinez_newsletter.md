**COVID Research Funding to Be Slashed, NIH Documents Show**

 US National Institutes of Health and CDC have begun cancelling billions of dollars in funding for research related to COVID-19. The crackdown comes as the NIH, under US President Donald Trump, has halted nearly 400 grants in the past month. The CDC plans to cancel $11.4 billion in funds for pandemic response, according to NBC News reports. It is not clear how many of these grants will be ended, and it is unclear how many will be terminated. The NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, has awarded grants to nearly 600 ongoing projects that include 'COVID' in the title.

**PFAS Found in Nearly Half of Americans’ Drinking Water**

 New data released by the EPA show that nearly half of people in the U.S. have drinking water contaminated by toxic “forever chemicals,” or PFAS. There are more than 9,000 known PFAS compounds, and more than 600 of them are used in a wide range of common products, from cookware to cosmetics to pesticides. The stability of PFAS molecules means they do not readily biodegrade in the environment and can linger and build up over years and decades.

**The First Sightings of Hofstadter's Butterfly Emerged from a Happy Accident**

 Princeton University scientists have observed a fractal pattern known as ‘Hofstadter’s butterfly’ in a new quantum material. The pattern has long been predicted, but the new study marks the first time it has been directly observed experimentally in a real material. Researchers weren't even trying to hatch the butterfly from its quantum chrysalis. The results are all the more remarkable because they were unexpected because they are unexpected— the researchers involved weren’t even attempting to hatch Hofstadter's butterfly.

**El tren de borrascas que desconcierta a los expertos en clima: "Todos los modelos hablaban de pérdida de lluvias hasta 2100, pero igual hay que revisarlo"**

 En España, de repente, ya nadie quiera hablar de sequía. La tren de borrascas atravesado la península de this a oeste in apenas two semanas. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) haya pintado de verde musgo los mapas de humedad del país. La reservas hídricas se hayan disparado hasta el 71,2%, la cifra más alta in esta época del año desde 2015.

**La lluvia dispara el riesgo de incendios en verano: "Se acumula vegetación muy inflamable, hay que tomar medidas ya"**

 Espacios naturales como Doñana o las Tablas de Daimiel están recobrando su esplendor tras muchos años en estado crítico. La Serena, in la provincia de Badajoz, o el de Alcántara, en Cáceres, han aumentado sus hectómetros cúbicos in una semana de manera brutal. "Hay que empezar ya a tomar medidas de prevención", advierte José Ramón González Pan, vocal of Ingenieros Técnicos Forestales de Madrid.

**Miguel López-Alegría, astronauta: "Es muy posible que Sara García pueda ir al espacio con una empresa privada como la nuestra"**

 Inventor of the world's largest nave, the International Space Agency, has been in contact with the U.S. since 2008. The agency has been involved in the process of dejejeinginging the world’s biggest nave. The U.N. agency has not been able to finalise a decision on what to do with the new nave. It has been hard to say: ‘I’ve got to say I’m not going to go with it.’

**What Caused the Magnitude 7.7 Myanmar and Thailand Earthquake?**

 A magnitude 7.7 earthquake shook Southeast Asia on March 28, 2025. The earthquake’s energy release was comparable to that of several hundred nuclear weapon explosions. The magnitude of this event was so high that it was felt in neighboring countries. A 30-story skyscraper under construction in Bangkok, 600 miles from the quake's epicenter, disintegrated. There will be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of casualties, as well as tens of billions of dollars of economic damage.

**Amid Trump Cuts, Climate Researchers Wait for the Ax to Fall**

 National Institutes of Health has canceled grants for research on diversity, Covid-19 and vaccines. Climate scientists are hoping their work won't be next — but fear it could be. An internal NIH memo outlined how the agency will no longer fund research on the health effects of climate change. At the University of Washington, Kristie Ebi is fearful that NIH could cut grants that fund studies about which populations are more vulnerable to extreme heat — a project that the team is planning to expand to include the dangers of wildfire smoke.

### Space exploration

**As Starlink and Other Satellites Proliferate, Astronomers Learn to Manage Interference**

 The number of working satellites has soared in the past five years to around 11,000, mostly because of constellations of orbiters that provide Internet connectivity around the globe. Satellites interfere with ground-based astronomical observations, by creating bright streaks on images and electromagnetic interference with radio telescopes. The satellite boom also poses other threats, including adding pollution to the atmosphosphorus.
