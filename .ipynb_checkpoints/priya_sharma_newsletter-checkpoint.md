**Judge orders CFPB to reinstate fired employees, preserve records and get back to work**

 A federal judge has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's leadership to halt its campaign to dismantle the agency. Judge Berman Jackson sided with the CFPB employee union that sued acting director Russell Vought last month to prevent him from laying off nearly all the staff. The order is the latest example in which a judge has pushed back against moves by the Trump administration to lay off federal employees and hobble disfavored agencies. Operatives from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have also been involved in efforts to fire employees.

**Startup founder Charlie Javice found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase in $175 million deal**

 Charlie Javice, 32, was convicted in federal court Friday of defrauding the bank by vastly overstating the company's customer list.

 Barry Ritholtz's new book, "How Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors That Destroy Wealth," is published March 18. The book is a history lesson of sorts, touching on pop culture and corporate pariahs like Steven Spielberg and The Beatles.

 Anand Rathi has curated a focused banking portfolio to ride the wave, which may offer up to 21% returns. The brokerage firm has favored a trio it believes is best poised for the upcycle. ICICI Bank retains the title of the ‘gold standard’, Axis Bank is seen as a direct ‘macro play’ and SBI earns the tag of ‘nimble elephant’ for its agility despite the scale.

**Joel Greenblatt defends value investing: It's not difficult to beat the market**

 Joel Greenblatt, 67, says traditional criteria that define "value" don't represent the essence of the philosophy. "We're literally valuing businesses, like we're private equity investors buying the whole business," he says. The Russell 1000 Value Index, including stocks with low price-to-book ratios and low sales-per-share growth, is up 189% over the past 20 years, compared to a 700% rise in its growth stock counterpart. Still, he says seasoned players with an eye for hidden gems are still able to perform better than the broader market.
